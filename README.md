Using machine learning and principles from finance to trade lego sets

## The Data
This project uses a combination of data from two API's
- Current Price - Bricklink API as of 05/10/2023
- List prices and features - Brickset API as of 05/10/2023

## The Model
Used a random forest and neural network and contrasted resulsts across the two models

## The Results

The models were able to predict list price and current market price extremely well from our selected features.

Our model was able to consistently beat the S&P 500 and an equal weighted portfolio across all lego sets produced in that year.

We analyzed feature importanace for determining list price.

We used the model to make a price forecast for the next five years.

Detailed results, plots, and analysis are all in `poster.pdf`.
